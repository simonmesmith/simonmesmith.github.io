Equally comfortable in a boardroom or IDE, Iâ€™m a 22-year tech industry veteran and former executive now pursuing my software engineering passion full-time. 

With a career that includes founding and building successful companies, brands, and departments, in 2022 I leveraged programming experience accrued through work-related and independent projects to start an exciting new chapter in my working life.

My current focus is building data-driven biomedical science applications using Python, SQL / BigQuery, Apache Beam / Dataflow, natural language processing tools and techniques, and applied machine learning.
