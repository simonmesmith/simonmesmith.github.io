Equally comfortable in a boardroom or IDE, Iâ€™m a 22-year tech industry veteran and former executive now pursuing my software engineering passion full-time.

With a career that includes founding and building successful companies, brands, and departments, in September 2022 I leveraged programming experience accrued through work-related and independent projects to start an exciting new chapter in my working life.

My current focus is data engineering on BenchSci's Discovery team, where I'm pushing the boundaries of data-driven biomedical science applications using large language models as well as other machine learning models and data engineering languages and tools including Python, SQL, and Apache Beam.
